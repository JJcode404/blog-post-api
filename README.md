The Blog Post API is a RESTful interface designed to manage blog content efficiently. It allows users to perform standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on blog posts. Each post includes fields such as title, body, author, tags, and publishedDate. The API also supports features like pagination, filtering by tags or author, and search functionality.
